# EssentialLinuxWorkarounds

Welcome to **EssentialLinuxWorkarounds**, a comprehensive guide to alternative Linux commands. When standard commands are unavailable or missing from your environment, this repository provides you with "hacky" yet effective alternatives to achieve your goals. It's a valuable resource for developers, system administrators, and researchers.

## Introduction

Linux is powerful, flexible, and, most of all, incredibly diverse in its applications. However, sometimes, due to various constraints like restricted environments, missing packages, or even broken installations, one might find themselves unable to use their go-to commands. **EssentialLinuxWorkarounds** comes to the rescue in such situations, offering alternative commands and techniques to accomplish tasks seamlessly.

## Commands and Alternatives

Below is the curated list of 50 essential Linux commands alongside their alternatives for those times when the conventional options arenâ€™t within reach.

1. `ls` alternative: `echo *`

13. `kill` alternative: `pkill -f process_name`
    - Kills processes by name.
    
14. `top` alternative: `ps aux | sort -nrk 3,3 | head -n 5`
